Simple example of keyboard focus styling with [ArcGIS API for javascript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/)

This web page was designed to show esri that the stylesheet in version 3.10 broke accessibility standards by
removing the focus ring (required for keyboard navigation) on not only the map elmenets, but also other
elments on the page.

Thankfully esri fixed this in a subsequent release of the javascript library.
